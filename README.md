# Small-multiples

## Definition :
Small multiples go by many names, including Trellis Chart, Lattice Chart, Grid Chart, and Panel Chart.
Small multiples are sets of charts of the same type, with the same scale, presented together at a small size and with minimal detail, usually in a grid of some kind.
They are a visualization concept introduced by Edward Tufte. He described them as:
"Illustrations of postage-stamp size are indexed by category or a label, sequenced over time like the frames of a movie, or ordered by a quantitative variable not used in the single image itself."
In other words, small multiples use the same basic graphic or chart to display difference slices of a data set. Small multiples can show rich, multi-dimensional data without trying to cram all that information into a single, overly-complex chart. 
Here is a simple example showing the use of small multiples. The following animated chart shows the evolution of populations in some selected countries :

  </tr>
